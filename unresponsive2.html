        <h1>Semantic UI Accordian - Not Working</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The source semantic UI component files are correct. And I am loading the latest version of jQuery.  The Accordian renders, but it does not function.  What am I doing wrong?  I tried using the main semantic.js and semantic.css files - that encompasses all components, but this also did not work. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Error Message in Safari Error Console</h3>
        <p> I only see one error.  It refers to the last line in the accordion.js or accordion.min.js file.  It reads "can't find variable jQuery".  and refers to a closing "}( jQuery, window, document);" statement.  I got the same error when trying to load an earlier version of jQuery 2.1.3.   What am I doing wrong?  </p>

                <p class="transition hidden">A pet shop may be the most convenient way to buy a dog. Buying a dog from a private owner allows you to assess the pedigree and upbringing of your dog before choosing to take it home. Lastly, finding your dog from a shelter, helps give a good home to a dog who may not find one so readily.</p>
